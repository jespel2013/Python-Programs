# Python-Programs
These are all Python programs I wrote for an advanced Python class at UofA accompanied by a brief description.

# Battleship.py

This program involves writing a program to model half of the actual battleship board game, namely, Player 1's ship placements and Player 2's guesses.  Details: https://www2.cs.arizona.edu/classes/cs120/fall17/ASSIGNMENTS/assg06/battleship.html

# Bball.py

This program reads in data about basketball teams (team name, conference, wins, losses) from a file, then calculates and prints out the conference(s) with the highest win ratio.  Details: https://www2.cs.arizona.edu/classes/cs120/fall17/ASSIGNMENTS/assg05/long-02-bball.html

# Dates.py

This program converts a text file of dates, events and inquiries.  It processes the inquiries by printing the events on the inquired date in alphabetical order.  Details: https://www2.cs.arizona.edu/classes/cs120/fall17/ASSIGNMENTS/assg07/dates.html

# Fake-news.py

This program analyzes some news articles to identify what subjects they focus on.  This is done by taking the words in the titles of recent news articles and organizing them in a linked list in descending order by the amount of times words occurs in the titles.  A more detailed description can be found here: https://www2.cs.arizona.edu/classes/cs120/fall17/ASSIGNMENTS/assg08/fake-news.html.

# Fake-news-ms.py

This program is behaviorally similar to Fake-news.py but the sorting is done using the Python list class and the merge sort algorithm.  

# Friends.py

This program uses a linked list data structure to find friends in common in a social network.  A more detailed description can be found here: https://www2.cs.arizona.edu/classes/cs120/fall17/ASSIGNMENTS/assg09/friends.html

# Huffman.py

This program builds a decoding tree and decodes a line of binary code.  Detailed description: https://www2.cs.arizona.edu/classes/cs120/fall17/ASSIGNMENTS/assg12/prefix-codes.html

# Linked-List.py

This file contains a class LinkedList that represents the data structure of the same name.

# ngrams.py

This program uses classes to read a user-specified file and organizes all the user specifiedsized ngrams.  It then prints out all the ngrams with the most appearances in the file.  Details: https://www2.cs.arizona.edu/classes/cs120/fall17/ASSIGNMENTS/assg05/long-01-ngrams.html

# Pokemon.py

#Purpose: This program takes a .csv file of different types of pokemon and their stats, organizes them, and prints out the Pokemon type with highest average statistic requested by the user.  Details: https://www2.cs.arizona.edu/classes/cs120/fall17/ASSIGNMENTS/assg02/pokemon.html

# Rhymes.py

This program takes in a user input and finds words that rhyme with that input.

# Rhymes.oo

Same as Rhymes but is implemented using objects/classes.  

# Street.py

This program takes a user input for a street and produces a rendering according to the user's specification.
Details: https://www2.cs.arizona.edu/classes/cs120/fall17/ASSIGNMENTS/assg11/street.html

# Word-grid.py

This program populates an N-sized grid with random letters.

# Word-search.py

This program takes input from two files: one with a list of words and one with a grid full of letters.
The program reads these files and searches to see if any of the words can be found in the grid, reminiscent of a crossword puzzle.
If there are any matches, the program prints out those matches.  

# writer-bot.py

This program acts as a writer bot and generates a pseudo-randomized text using the Markov Chain algorithm.

# writer-bot-ht.py

Behaviorally the same as writer-bot.py but this program is implemented using hash tables.
